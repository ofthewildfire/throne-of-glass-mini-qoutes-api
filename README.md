## Features:

- Access individual quotes by ID (starting from 1).

## Deployment:

## Endpoints:

  "quote": "Her mother placed a phantom hand over Aelinâ€™s heart. It is the strength of this that matters. No matter where you are, no matter how far, this will lead you home."
}

If an invalid ID is used to access a quote, the API will return an error object with the message "No quote".
